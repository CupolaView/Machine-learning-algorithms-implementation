# Machine-learning-algorithms-implementation
Following assignments/mini-projects, where done in Python as part of Pattern Recognition course at University of Waterloo:
1.	Visualization of data and drawing decision boundary for ML and MAP classifiers.
2.	Implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch for MNIST dataset, to extract d most important features for POV = 95%, also plotting the output after extracting d features for various ds. Reconstructing the images after applying PCA. Programming k-nearest neighbors (KNN) from scratch for the same task above for various Ks and comparing PCA and KNN.
3.	Implementing C4.5 decision tree from scratch to classify UCI categorical and continuous datasets. Then using 10-times-10-fold cross validation to find accuracy for noisy datasets (contradictory and misclassified examples).
4.	Implementing bidirectional search (BDS) algorithm from scratch to find best K features for MNIST dataset, for various Ks, and reporting the classification accuracy with KNN.
5.	Implementing the last instruction above with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) instead of BDS, again from scratch. 
6.	Implementing Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) for two class problem with different regularisation parameters (C) and finding the best C.
7.	Implementing an ensemble of 50 linear SVMs using Adaboost-M1 approach to classify a two-class problem.
